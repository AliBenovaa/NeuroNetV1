# Convert Images to Poissonian Spikes

Convert your image data to a Poisson spike source to be able to use with Spiking Neural Networks.

**[convert_image_to_spike_array.py](convert_image_to_spike_array.py)** is the main file. 
  - Please see its usage by running it: `python convert_image_to_spike_array.py`
  - The program will store the output spike array as a _pickle_ under _pickles/_ folder in the same directory after the run. 
  - The program will create a folder called plots, tha twill store 4 rester plots with spike trains for each image. 
  - If you do not want a _pickle_ at the end, change the parameter inside the file, i.e. `save_as_pickle=False`.
  - You may use a single image file (extension could be anything _OpenCV_ accepts) or a folder which contains multiple images (extensions need to be _.png_) as input.

**[draw_image.py](draw_image.py)** enables you to draw your own images by adding simple shapes into it via _OpenCV_. For more information please see the file.

**[images](images/)** folder contains three of the images that I generated by using _draw_image.py_, and one example from MNIST dataset (t10k-images-idx3-ubyte__idx_000__lbl_7_.png).

**[poisson_tools.py](poisson_tools.py)** is where the Poisson distribution modelling takes place.

**[util_functions.py](util_functions.py)** includes utility functions of files and images.

## References and Citation
I only used the Poissonian spikes approach to obtain spike arrays from images in this project. The original project also contains _Focal Rank Code Order_ approach in this sense.

Please refer to the original project's [Wiki page](https://github.com/NEvision/NE15/wiki) for further information.
